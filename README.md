Hey there! I’m an Engineer, Security Researcher, Algorithmic Forex Trader, Investor, Athlete, and Traveler — a curious mind who thrives on exploration, both in technology and in life.

I’ve always been fascinated by how systems work - whether it’s a complex cybersecurity framework, a financial market algorithm, or the mechanics of peak human performance. I love to break things apart, understand their core, and rebuild them stronger, smarter, and more secure.

By day, I dive deep into engineering and security research, uncovering how technology can be both powerful and vulnerable. By night (and sometimes early mornings), I trade in the forex markets, using my tech-driven mindset to build and refine custom algorithmic tools that automate and optimize trading strategies. These in-house systems help me stay ahead of market trends and make smarter, faster financial decisions.

Beyond tech and finance, I’m a sports enthusiast and traveler who thrives on challenge and adventure. Whether it’s testing my limits on the field or exploring new cultures and experiences, I believe growth comes from stepping beyond comfort zones.

At the end of the day, everything I do - from research to trading to exploring — comes down to one core mission: to use my skills to build wealth, create freedom, and continuously learn. I’m a lifelong learner who’s always curious, always experimenting, and always evolving.

Welcome to my world — where technology, finance, and adventure intersect.
